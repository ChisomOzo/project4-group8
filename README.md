## Project Overview
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Project! This comprehensive project recommends movies to users based on their favourite movie that was watched by users in the past. Leveraging a Flask API to serve data to the frontend, the project's user interface is developed using the deep learning model. The dataset used had usersâ€™ rating on past movies watched, using those ratings we were able to create a model that would predict the movie that the user will watch and provide a high rating.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `app.py`: Contains the Flask API implementation.
- `index.html`: For HTML templates.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from the following sources:


## Data Cleanup and Analysis:
Data cleanup and analysis are performed in visual studio code. Explore, clean, and reformat data to prepare it for analysis. 

## Flask API
The Flask API (`app.py`) serves as the backend for the project. It handles data retrieval and user-driven interactions. 


## Frontend Development
The frontend is built using HTML User-driven interactions are implemented using a JS library.
